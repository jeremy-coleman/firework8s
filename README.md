# Firework8s
Firework8s is a collection of Kubernetes objects (YAML files) for deploying workloads in a home lab with k8s. The 
home lab used for development of this project consists of a 3 node cluster managed by Rancher.

## Project Structure
Folder | Description 
--------------- | ---------------
yaml-examples   | Contains pure handcrafted Kubernetes YAML; These files can be considered the gold standard for the project
cdk8s-examples  | Contains [Cloud Development for Kubernetes (cdk8s)](https://github.com/awslabs/cdk8s) TypeScript files that can be used by cdk8s to generate Kubernetes YAML

## Deploy
### Using yaml-examples
Execute kubectl apply -f against the directory you wish to deploy.  For example:
```shell script
cd yaml-examples
kubectl apply -f sonarr
```
Would deploy Sonarr to your Kubernetes cluster...

### Using cdk8s-examples
Create a new cdk8s project project in Typescript and use it to generate Kubernetes YAML files for deployment: 
```shell script
cd cdk8s-examples
mkdir build && cd build
cdk8s init typescript-app
npm run watch &
cp ../*.ts .
cdk8s synth
```

Execute kubectl apply -f against the application you wish to deploy.  For example:
```shell script
kubectl apply -f dist/jackett.k8s.yaml
```
Would deploy Jackett from the cdk8s generated YAML to your Kubernetes cluster...

## Applications
The following applications are included as yaml and cdk8s examples.
